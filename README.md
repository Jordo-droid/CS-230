-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The Gaming Room was a client that required their gaming applicaiton, Draw it or Lose it, to be streamed across multiple platforms running on different Operating systems.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? I think the code produced for the application is done well within the standard guidelines. It's modular, allowing for updates to the game to be added in the future and provides an easy to read structure that will allow other programmers to quickly figure out what is going on.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? The general layout of the document was helpful in focusing my analysis of the program, it's functionality, and possibilities. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? The biggest need of the user was that the program be useable across different platform types. I think that the code written for the application allows for the game to be used and tweaked for the various OS available today. User's needs are important as they are the focus behind the code that we write.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? In line comments help a lot towards keeping track of what has been completed within a project, and I used plenty of them. I think the future, I would want to do something similar as I did with this project. That is, commenting, and developing the application in pieces.
